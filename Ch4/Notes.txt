PROPS: (Properties)
Something that we can pass to the component
Whenever we need to pass dynamic data to a component we use prop
Similar like passing arguments to a function
eg:
<RestaurantCard resName = "Meghana Foods" cuisine="Biryani">
React will take all these props and wrap it in an object and pass it to RestaurantCard
const RestaurantCard = (props) => { props.resName, props.cuisine }

Generally, we get restaurant data in form of json

Config driven UI: (Swiggy website) - UI is driven by a config. UI can show different data or cards etc for different cities
We can control our UI based on data coming from backend


WHY WE NEED TO USE A KEY WHILE LOOPING IN REACT:
React optimises its render cycles when there are components at the same level. These components need to have
unique id because suppose a new restaurant came in and it came in at the first place and there was no ID, react would have to
re render all the restaurant cards because it does not know that which restaurant card is the latest one added
If we give them a unique id, react exactly knows and will only render one restaurant
Never use indexes as keys
