Jo dikhta hai wo bikta hai

Various Ways to write css in react projects: 
1) basic way like we used till now
2) Use scss 
3) Inline css 
4) Styled components
5) Frameworks like tailwind, material ui

Suppose a class is not available in tailwind 
eg width 200px 
there is square bracket notation to give dynamic value
class = "w-[200px]"

Pros of tailwind: 
Easy to use
no duplicate css 
bundle size small 
faster development 
Easy to debug

Cons: 
Many classes to use for single component
Initial learning curve
