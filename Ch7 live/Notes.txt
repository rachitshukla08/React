FINDING THE PATH

use of useEffect hook
useEffect is a hook which is called after the component is rendered
without a dependency array, it will be called after every render
We can use more than one useEffects also

REQUIRED Practices
1) Never create a omponent inside thr funcyion of another component
2) Never write the useState hook inside if else or a for loop
3) Never use useState outside of functional component

Single Page Application:
Our application does not reload 
There are 2 types of routing: 
1) Client Side Routing  : Routing is done from client side, no network call to fetch another page is reqd.
2) Server Side Routing: Whenever the route changes, the new page will come from the server




React Router: (React Router v6)
1) Create router configuration 
import {createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider} from 'react-router-dom'

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
]);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);

All the children will go into the outlet
