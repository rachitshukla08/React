Creating your own create react app (Production ready app)

package.json is a configuration for npm

most imp package: Bundler
What is a bundler?
Our whole code needs to be bundled, cleaned, minified, compressed to be sent to prod
This role is performed by bundler
We will use parcel as bundler
It creates
-Dev build
-Local server
-Hot module replacements (It uses file watching algorithm which is written in c++)
-Faster builds(through caching)
-Image optimisation
-Minification
-Bundle
-Compress 
-Consistent hashing
-Code splitting
-Differential Bundling (support old browser)
-Diagnostic
-Error handling
-HTTPs
-Tree shaking (Remove unused code)
to create prod build = npx parcel build index.html

Types of dependencies:
1) Dev: Required in development phase
2) Normal: Used in production

NPX : Executing a package  eg: npx parcel index.html
it searches for the package in the local and global registry, and then it runs the package. 
If the package is not already installed, NPX downloads the package files and installs the package, 
but it will only cache the files instead of saving it.


When we remove script loading for react from index.html and add package for react. Then we import that package in app.js
we will get an error Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.
Because It considers the js file as a normal js file and not a module
so we need to add type = module
