JSX is not HTML Inside JSX
JSX was created to make writing react elements easier and developer friendly
JSX is an HTML Like syntax or XML like syntax
The jsx code is transpiled before it reaches the javascript engine. This transpilation is done by parcel through a package called babel
Behind the scenes, jsx code is converted to react.createElement, which later converts to JS object and then rendered to DOM as html element 
Attributes are written in camelcase eg className
Single line jsx can be written directly eg: const heading = <h1> heading </h1> but multiline JSX needs to be 
wrapped in paranthesis  () 
JSX can only have single root element


React Components: 
Ways to create component 
1) Class based Components (Old way)
2) Functional components  (New way) - Normal JS Function which returns some JSX element (or a ReactElement (same thing))
eg: const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Namaste react functional component</h1>
}
To render a react component : 
root.render(<HeadingComponent />);

React Fragments: 
To put multiple root elements without rendering a parent element in JSX we can wrap it inside <React.Fragment>  </React.Fragment>
(similar to vue template)
behaves like an empty tag.
We can also use empty tag instead of this <> </>
