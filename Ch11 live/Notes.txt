Ch 10

Prop drilling: 
Passing props from one parent to a child and to another (like a chain) P-> C-> C->C ....
Disadvantage: 
1) In case of lot of components, we have to make change in every component to pass it to child (Unnecessary code)
2) It rerenders every component in the chain 

React Context: 
Used to create global state (Central place to store data)
